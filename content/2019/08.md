- [autobake: Create [Nix] build recipes through automated trial and error](https://github.com/jameysharp/autobake) (an early prototype)

  The project attempts to auto-detect missing dependencies when writing a new Nix expression. In the author's words:
  
  *"During a build [with missing dependencies], autobake watches which files the build process tries and fails to open.
  After the build finishes (whether successful or not), autobake looks for packages which contain the missing files.
  This approach may over-estimate the build dependencies, when build systems check for the existence of software they
  don't actually need. [Still], it takes a lot less work to remove dependencies by hand than it does to guess which
  packages might be necessary."*
